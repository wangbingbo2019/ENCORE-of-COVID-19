S1 Table. Human interactome. It contains 16,461 proteins and 239,305 physical interactions. This network is provided by 'Menche J, Sharma A, Kitsak M, et al. Disease networks. Uncovering disease-disease relationships through the incomplete interactome. Science 2015; 347.'

S2 Table. Disease biology of core. Disease module. The peripheral proteins and core proteins of COVID-19, SARS and H1N1, and the 70 C3 disease modules. 

S3 Table. The disease relationship result. The disease relationship analysis of COVID-19 and 72 disease modules, using the core proteins and VHN proteins of COVID-19 to calculate, respectively. 

S4 Table. Clinical drug list. Collected 67 drugs currently undergoing clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/).

S5 Table. Drug prediction result. The top 1,000 drugs in the ranking of drugs based on the distance between VHN and drug targets.

S6 Table. Flower model for COVID-19, SARS and H1N1. Described the relationship between the three diseases based on overlap and distance in the network, listed the mediator proteins between VHN & SARS and VHN & N1N1, presented the enrichment analysis result of overlap proteins and mediator proteins, and showed the consequence of drug validation. 

S7 Table. Drug target interactions. Contains 15,051 drug target interactions, which linking 4,428 drugs to 2,256 unique human targets.
